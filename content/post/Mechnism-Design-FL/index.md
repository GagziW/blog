# What is Mechanism Deisgn and why does it matter

Since I can remember I was intrigued by how some people are able to thrive under the worst of circumstances while others crack under minor issues in our relatively easy and pleasureful modern life. The more time I spent researching extraordinary individuals, the stronger my gutfeeling that there is a linking-something which combines successful humans across time, culture and circumstances. On my quest to find out I stumbled upon an ancient philosophy which seems to be the missing link I was looking for: [stoicicm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism#:~:text=Stoicism%20is%20a%20school%20of,views%20on%20the%20natural%20world). Stoicim is the genuine philosophy that whatever comes across you in terms of events, destiny and catastrophies are netral by nature. The only thing what makes them good or bad are our received perception and our emotions towards them. Both are trainable. The 2 millenia old manuscript [Meditations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditations) by Markus Aurelius, one of the founding fathers of Stoicicm and Roman Emperor struck me in particular: All of his meditations about society and how to build a successful mindset seem to be 100% applicable in our 21st Century Life. Admittedly with some level of abstraction, we are facing the same problems, having the same thoughts as we had 2000 years ago. I realized, that the way how we as individuals- but also we as society work has not changed at all.


Being (to some extent) predictable and rational as humans paved the path of the research direction we now call economics. In almost all real life situations where people, companies or even countries collaborate is it crucial to be able to anticipate other reactions and behaviors with respect to your own moves. The branch of economics which deals with how rational indiviuals behave under specific circumstances is called [Game Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory). 

Sometimes you want to artificially set the ramifications of a battlefield so that a particular objective will be reached. In other words, you want to [design a mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_design#:~:text=Mechanism%20design%20is%20a%20field,settings%2C%20where%20players%20act%20rationally.) that results in an equilibrium of your choice.
